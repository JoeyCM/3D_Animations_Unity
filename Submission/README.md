# Class exercise 3D Animations to Unity

## Exercise

The following repository hosts the final in-class exercise of our lecture '3D Animation' from CITM-UPC university.

The main objective of this exercise was to create 9 different simple animations (Walking Backward and Forward, Running, Jumping, Slashing, Stabbing, Impact, Strafing Left and Strafing Right), adn then importing them into a Unity project and attach a simple key-controller map to see the result.

## Controls

- Impact -> H
- Strafe Left -> A
- Strafe Right -> D
- Jumping -> SPACEBAR
- Attack 1 (Stab) -> K
- Attack 2 (Slash) -> S
- Walk Forward -> (Default animation)
- Walk Backward  -> B
- Running -> R
